# Whisper-Diarisation-Multilingual
Diarized transcription of audiofiles in languages other than English. Google Cloud says this is not possible, but it is (not perfect, but with a rather high level of accuracy).

This presupposes that you have a folder with audio files containing one single speaker per file (30 seconds are enough). I used Miguel Valente's [https://github.com/miguelvalente/whisperer](Whisperer) to extract single speakers from multi-speaker audio first.
